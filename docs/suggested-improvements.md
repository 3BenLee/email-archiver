# Suggested Improvements

- First off from a design perspective, I might make the UI more colorful.
- I would also suggest creating accounts and having a log in system possibly using JSON web token authentication and Node.JS.
 With a log in system we could then implement saved search parameters and we could save search results in other. 
- We could also add a file system to store search results for use later.
- Another useful feature might be a string search input. This could be implemented with basic JS logic and maybe some regex.
- It might also be useful to create a way to view attachments. We could use a modal popup perhaps to do so.
