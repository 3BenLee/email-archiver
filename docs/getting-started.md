# Getting Started

This app was built using create react app.

to run the app in development mode:

    yarn start

## Things to know before starting

 1. I made my own mock data stored in the `data` file. The data dates
  start on April 20, 2018 and go through August 20, 2019. So please
  search within those dates to generate results.

 2. I created this project using the adaptive approach. The app will display either mobile or desktop UI based on device screen size. So please toggle mobile and desktop mode in the dev tools to view the different versions.
